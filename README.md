## Inspiration
We would like to build a healthcare platform that bring patients and healthcare providers closer together through utilizing modernized approaches to track and record symptom monitoring.

## What it does
LinkFactor utilizes a system that applies a very standards compliant implementation of the FHIR Questionnaires to track and record data about patients. Patients are asked for consent to share data and to be recontacted in the future in the survey form. 

Further, LinkFactor provides real time virtual assistant chatbot that asks patients about their symptoms and provides advice for the symptoms. There is also virtual meeting room service with video calling for connecting the patients with doctors for consultation. 

## How we built it
- We built LinkFactor using Medplum to get data from patients, clinicians, staff and other stakeholders using custom forms. Forms go by questionnaires to collect data from a user in a standard way. Medplum supports collecting form data in a standards compliant way and using it to enforce QA or ensure conformance. Forms can be completed by practitioners when they meet patients. The Medplum Forms implementation is a very standards compliant implementation of the FHIR Questionnaires. 
- We built video meeting features using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Agora.
- We built the AI Chatbot using AWS AI.  Claude (LLM) allowed us to analyze text inputs of the users. The combination of Claude (LLM) and AWS AI provides a comprehensive and secure platform for web development. 
- We built the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Consent & Recontact
Ask patients for consent to share data and recontact for research in data questionnaire form and before using the services

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to put everything together to meet the deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build forms that are FHIR standards. We were able to set a system in Medplum that collects data from patients in  FHIR compliance. We were able to build the video meeting service as well as AI Chatbot. 

## What we learned
We learnt about FHIR standards and the way health care app should be developed. We learnt to build video meeting using Agora as well as AI Chatbot using Claude LLM. 

## What's next for LinkFactor
- We would like to improve the security of the web page and the system that stores data from users. 
- We want to add more functions that allow doctors and patients closer together such as real time chat with doctors
- We want to offer game like dashboard that encourages patients to fill info
